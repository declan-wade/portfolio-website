## Overview:

**Final Product:** https://www.stirling.wa.gov.au/planning-and-building/fast-track-(development-applications)

**Role:** Business analyst, SME, concept design, wireframing

**Technology:** HTML, TechnologyOne, JavaScript 

## Role and Involvement: 

* This project was a WA Local Government first and was completely bespoke for our use case.
* The final project scope was the culmination of months of concept design, business requirement gathering, stakeholder negotiation and several proofs-of-concept.
* I was instrumental in developing the business requirements and overall concept for how the system would eventually work, most of which I prepared as my own initiative in my spare time.
* Alongside the developer, I held a number of workshops with internal stakeholders to discuss system architecture and technology choice (including cybersecurity, TechOne vs Salesforce, front-end frameworks, and authentication)
