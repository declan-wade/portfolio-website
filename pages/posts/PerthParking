## Overview:

A simple live tracker for all the CPP parking sites in Perth, Western Australia. Data is courtesy of City of Perth and is cached appropriatly by the server.
**Final Product:** [Access Here](https://perth-parking.vercel.app/) - Can take up to 10 secs to load data. 

**Role:** Hobby

**Technology:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, REST APIs, Serverless, NextUI.

## Rationale:

* I wanted to try and make a quick and easy way to view the parking availability from CPP's website.
* This was one of my first tests of the NextUI framework and am very happy with how it turned out.
* There is definitely room for improvement but I'm happy with the technology stack and lack of reliance on databases.
