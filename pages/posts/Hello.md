# Role and Involvement

* Project was a key deliverable as part of the Small Business Improvement Initiative, and an Australian Local Government first.
* I worked with management to identify key delivery targets the product needed to achieve, primarily scope and user story from the perspective of a range of different customers: ratepayers, developers, and businesses owners. As each user type had different backgrounds and use cases, the product needed to cater for all. 
* I developed an initial wireframe of how a user would step-through the product. As this was a customer-facing solution, it was critical that the functionality was easy to follow and intuitive. 
*This led to discussions with management on appropriate platform choice and resourcing, settling on Salesforce using the existing in-house team for front and back-end development. 
* The service needed to deliver correct information on the highly complex and nuanced local planning framework. I assisted in mapping all the logical pathways for the planning requirements to ensure it was understandable and clear for the Salesforce developers to implement. This was a significant task due to the ‘branching’ process of the website, with dozens of options that required different parameters for each choice. This also required engagement with representatives from other Business Units to capture requirements from Health, Building and Environmental Teams. 
* As this began to be developed in a testing environment, I created a testing framework for representatives from each Business Unit to run through functionality and ensure the logic steps were correct and matched their specific requirements. Feedback was provided back to me, where I then conveyed this onto the development team and product owner. As the development team used an agile project management process, the testing needed to be completed at the end of each sprint. 
* I developed documentation for the internal users, conducted training exercises and handover to management once the development period concluded.
