# Involvement:

* I was the development lead on this project, and was by far the most code I had written in my career. This was also my first time doing major coding for a client. 
* Although I had limited experience with TypeScript, React and JavaScript when starting the project, I learnt an enormous amount and am proud of the final product. 
* The build itself was extremely fast, the bulk of the work was done within two weeks. 
* I also had to develop an interface for the backend to communicate with SQL Server and expose an API, which I used the Sequalize library to achieve.
