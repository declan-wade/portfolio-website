* We had a small office of only five desks, sometimes causing confusion when several people wanted to come and use a desk but none being available. I wanted to build something to allow staff to choose which days they needed a desk and provide visibility to the organisation on availablity. 
* I used Microsoft Power Apps for the app itself, and Sharepoint to store the data. This allowed the app to be completely free for internal users, no additional licenses required. 
* Power Apps includes fulll integration with Azure Active Directory out-of-the-box for easy deployment.
