## Overview:

**Final Product:** Your here!

**Role:** Developer

**Source Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/declan-wade/portfolio-website)

**Technology:** Vercel, Next.js, Nextra, GitHub

## Rationale:

* Wanted something quick and easy to setup and deploy, of which this template was ideal
* Used technology I was familiar with, especially Next.js
* I prefer using markdown where possible, as it provides a good writing experiance. 
* Setup and deployment of this site took <2 hours. Using Vercel as a web-host, I am able to deploy directly from GitHub and use my custom domain all for free.
